Algorithm visualization illustrates how algorithms work in graphical way.  It mainly aims to simplify  and deepen the understanding of algorithms operation.

Within the paper we discuss  the possibility of enriching the standard methods of teaching algorithms. With the algorithm visualization. As a step in this direction , we introduce the Visual Effector Algorithm Visualization platform. 

	Algorithm Visualization is an interactive online Platform that visualizes algorithms from code
